# SVHN Transfer learning example with Pytorch

## How to use

1) Download data with download_data.sh
2) Train and evaluate with SVHN_transfer_learnign.ipynb

## Learning curves

Train loss
![train loss](/img/train_loss.jpg "Train loss")

Validation loss
![validation loss](/img/val_loss.jpg "Val loss")

Train accuracy
![train acc](/img/train_acc.jpg "Train acc")

Validation accuracy
![validation acc](/img/val_acc.jpg "Val acc")

## Test accuracy

Test loss = 0.218, Test accuracy = 0.937

## Ways to improvements

1) Right augmentations (high priority). Try to provide grid search on diff types/levels augmentations.
2) Another architecture
3) Hyperparameters tuning
